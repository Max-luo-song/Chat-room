# Function Description

This project completes a chat room that supports one-on-one chat and group chat, and uses pyqt to design a friendly human-computer interaction interface. If you want to use this project, you can begin to understand the structure from the main.py. But **Now it has a disadvantage. Private chat is actually implemented by group chat, so it only supports private chat between two people**
